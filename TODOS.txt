PROJECT CONCEPT
Users can essentially use the application to record a timeline of their life through journal entries which will someday support video and photo uploads. Users can write about anything to recollect a memory or event that was significant in their life. The application will create a timeline that is both user friendly and easy to use, that displays snippets of entries on certain dates. Users may even share their timeline with friends and family, and maybe even someday see how their timelines connect with friends and family. May potentially include a feature that allows people to build a family tree... 

Almost like TimeHop, but not quite....
